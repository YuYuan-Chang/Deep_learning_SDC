# Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars (SDC)

## Introduction
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model tailored for self-driving cars. It leverages advanced neural network architectures to interpret and respond to complex driving environments.

## Project Overview
- The main Jupyter Notebook (`SDC.ipynb`) contains the code for data preparation, model development, and simulation integration.
- Data collection and preprocessing techniques are implemented, focusing on image data associated with steering angles.
- The project uses a convolutional neural network, inspired by NVIDIA's model for autonomous driving.
- It includes image augmentation techniques like zooming, panning, adjusting brightness, and flipping to enhance the model's robustness.
- The model is trained and validated on a dataset, and its performance is visualized.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the neural network
- OpenCV and imgaug for image processing and augmentation
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development

## Installation and Setup
Clone the repository and install the necessary Python packages. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed to open and run `SDC.ipynb`.
